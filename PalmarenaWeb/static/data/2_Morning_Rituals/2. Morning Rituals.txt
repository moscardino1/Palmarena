In the morning, Fulvio is preparing breakfast while Jessica is still sleeping. The house is well stocked with supplies to live there for a week. The coffee is ready, Fulvio pours some into two turquoise Vietri ceramic cups and places them on a tray with some week old pastries found in the kitchen. He reaches his girlfriend, who is still sleeping, lying naked in the French bed; for a moment, he forgets about breakfast and places the tray on the table in front of the bed to wake Jessica. She opens her sleepy eyes and is still not awake. “Give me a kiss,” she yawns towards him as he slips between the sheets. Her skin is smooth and soft; he can’t help but caress her all the way to her hair and fill her with small kisses.
