An R129 speeds along the panoramic road between the rocks and the sea, the sound of the gear shifting precedes every brake, leaving a trail of dust behind mixed with the strong smell of exhaust. Down below, the sea is a stretch of blue dunes, the waves are regular and geometrically formed by the wind. The sun is no longer high, and the evening breeze begins to blow, cooling the air.

The car stops at a green gate, Fulvio presses the button on the black and blue Faac remote; it slowly opens inward, revealing a paved driveway bordered by agaves and pines. The Mercedes descends along the winding road, the cicadas still buzzing, and the asphalt is covered with sand and pebbles.

Fulvio brakes, signaling that they have arrived; Palmarena stands before them. Jessica reaches for her vintage Birkin resting on the back seat and searches for her cigarettes. After finding one, she takes a moment to light it before getting out of the car, the smoke curling into the air as she exhales slowly. 

Fulvio gets out of the car heading towards the house, twirling the keychain of Palmarena with his finger. It is a single-story villa made of red bricks with a sloping roof, a dark green shutter closes the entrance. Jessica gets out, vaulting over the door of the convertible, running towards Fulvio to give him a kiss on the neck. Then she gives him a playful slap on the back and says, “I love you to madness.” He pretends not to notice and tries to open the front door. When they enter, it is all dark. “Alberto sent us to this dump... he always pulls these tricks on us,” says Jessica, there is a strong smell of mold, and Fulvio works to open all the shutters to let in some air. “Look at that view of God from here, you can see an island, actually two... What is that rock jutting out of the water? It makes me want to take a swim! Let’s go, Jes?” Jessica doesn’t respond, she hasn’t even heard, she is wandering around the house looking for something to do, she doesn’t want to go back to the car. She opens everything without closing it with extreme speed, not caring about anything. “Damn, it’s a dump, not even a snack left lying around, I hate this place, but at least does it have a pool? ” Jessica grumbles, not caring about what she says, while Fulvio remains in front of a rectangular window two meters by two, gazing at the two islands in front of him. He thinks of enjoying that moment, takes out a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket, and lights one. “What a paradise, I want to stay here for a while, Jes, get used to it because we’re staying here for at least two weeks, I need to take a swim, there should be a pool behind the bedrooms. Alberto was here last week; he told the caretaker I would be arriving today.” Meanwhile, Jessica has undressed and turned on the radio. She has turned the volume up to the maximum; an old Kylie Minogue tape is playing. “I found the pool, the water is dirty, but I don’t care, I’m hot, come take a swim with me?” Jessica is naked in front of the pool and is about to dive in, Fulvio has reached her, kisses her wavy blonde hair, and takes off her black Celine glasses. “I love you too,” says Fulvio, “You are my goddess,” Jessica dives in and starts swimming. Fulvio watches the girl as she swims, her freestyle is impeccable, but after one lap, she stops. She climbs the green copper ladder at the corner of the pool and trembles, cold and sitting on the edge. Fulvio reaches her from the other side and hugs her. “Fu, can you bring me a bathrobe?” While he goes to the bathroom to get what she asked for, Jessica dives back in.

This June, Alberto and Genni decided to spend the weekend away from Rome. Fulvio invited them to his parents' villa, located by the seaside just two hours away. A university friend of Alberto, they had met in their first year of Law, and they knew that their friendship would soon change as Fulvio was preparing to leave for a master's program in the United States right after his graduation in July. He was eager to host them before embarking on this new chapter in his life.

Fulvio's parents had lived in Chicago for three years, having moved there when his father was offered a position as a board member at Merrell Partnership Inc. due to his successful management of merger operations in Rome. Fulvio had thus been living alone in his house on the Aventine at Via Santa Melania since he was 22. Often feeling lonely, he appreciated the dinner invitations from his friend Alberto, which made him feel connected and supported; he was genuinely sad about their impending move.

On that June Sunday, Alberto stopped by Guido's house after 2 PM to pick up the keys to Fulvio's parents' seaside house. The night before at dinner, he had managed to convince Genni to join him for the weekend. Although Alberto had previously declined Fulvio's invitation several times, this time he was persuaded by Genni, who had expressed a desire for a change of scenery and a break from their routine.

Fulvio had given him a set of keys, explaining and showing him on a map how to reach the villa.
Genni lived on Via Donato Bramante, not far from the Aventine.
